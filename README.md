# Assignment 6

## Typography
I picked these fonts because they look clean with the white background. Most fashion stuff wants to portay a clean mood and I feel that these do that well.

## Readability
I added a bit more line height to make it more readable. I also adjusting the text-size for some headers to make them stand out more. I decreased the length of a few paragraphs in order to make them all similar length to help the readability. Last, I darkened the colors a bit in order to make them stand out against the background a bit more.
